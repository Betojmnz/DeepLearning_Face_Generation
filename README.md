# DeepLearning_Face_Generation
## Overview
Creation of a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network DCGAN to create human faces based on a repertoire of celebrity images.

## Additional info
The dataset used is call CelebA, which  contains over 200,000 celebrity images.
Both the Generator and Discriminator have 4 convolutional layers and one fully-connected layer.
